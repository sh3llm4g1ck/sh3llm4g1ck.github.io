# About Me
My name is sh3llm4g1ck, interested in CTF about 7 years now. My background story is quite complicated, I've been online with different nicknames through the years, been on top 10 in various CTF platforms, posted papers on exploit-db and much more. For some reason 2 years ago I gave up, I thought this field isn't for me. Now after long time I start all over again from 0, I still remember some things but I want to start from 0 throught beginner level CTFs and level up.

In this blog, I'll post all my journey whatever Im doing to keep notes for myself and maybe help others too. If you want take a seat and let the journey begin!
