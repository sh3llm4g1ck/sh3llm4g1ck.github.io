Welcome, welcome. There are ton of tutorials on how to make a discord bot with python but most of them are fucked up, missing things, outdated, forget to explain things, they make you to join their server to get the code etc you got the point. So I decided to make some 1337 tutorials on how to make one with full explanation that will cover everything and share the logic of how to search and do things. 

The tutorials will be based on GNU\Linux, if you're a windows user then bad for you. Use your search engine to find a way to do the corresponding things.
I don't know how many tutorials I'll make until we cover everything, I'll see. At the end of the tutorials you will be an 1337 bot developer, I guess.

Let's start, you will need: discord(software/browser), browser, terminal, brain. 

# Make a Guild/Server

You can't do shit without a guild/server. I bet the majority already know how to make one but I'll show it for those who don't know.

1) Click on the plus symbol.

# Create a Bot Account

In order to work with discord API we need to have a bot account, first go to discord.com and log in then move to [Developer Portal/Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications){:target="_blank"}

1) First let's create a new application.
