Welcome, welcome. There are ton of tutorials on how to make a discord bot with python but most of them are fucked up, missing things, outdated, forget to explain things, they make you to join their server to get the code etc you got the point.

The tutorials will be based on GNU\Linux, if you're a windows user then bad for you. Use your search engine to find a way to do the corresponding things.
Let's start, you will need: discord(software/browser), browser, terminal, brain.
