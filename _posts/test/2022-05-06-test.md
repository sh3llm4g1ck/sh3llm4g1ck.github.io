Welcome, welcome. There are ton of tutorials on how to make a discord bot with python but most of them are fucked up, missing things, outdated, forget to explain things, they make you to join their server to get the code etc you got the point. So I decided to make some 1337 tutorials on how to make one with full explanation that will cover everything and share the logic of how to search and do things.
